When a dev forks and clones a repo, the original (forked) repo is called the upstream. 

git remote add upstream https://github.com/foo/bar

does:

git remote -v
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)

In order to keep your remote repo synced with the original (forked) upstream.
