In most version control environments (like git or beanstalk) there is some form of 'lines' (see it as a metaphore for working copies) running parallel and basically all over the place, just how ever you like it. In git these 'lines' are called branches and the most popular use for them is when a dev starts adding a new feature to a repo he branches it in order to retain working branches and also make cooperating with other devs easier.
